Volume of house - KW requirement: http://www.airtech.co.nz/calculator.html

"Though sizing a system should be handled by a professional, you can get a rough idea of size by figuring about 400 square feet of living space per ton in older houses, so, a 1,600-square-foot house would normally require about a 4-ton system. Newer houses with double-paned windows and more insulation can get by with smaller systems." http://www.hometips.com/buying-guides/heat-pumps.html

* Allow about 44 watts per cubic metre of room volume.
* Add another 10 percent for a large window area and another 10 to 20 percent for partial or no insulation.
* If it's a lounge, multiply by 1.5. If it's a bedroom, make it 1.2, and for other areas multiply by 0.8.

Mitsubishi says:
55watts per m³ for a well insulated house
65watts per m³ for a cold damp house or lots of glass

Finally let’s take a general example, such as middle Europe winter weather, a living room with normal insulation condition, 2.8m ceiling height, it needs about 90W per square meters, to warm the room to be around 20 ℃. Of course you can also use 80W or even 70W per sqm, that will be just a problem of needing more time.
